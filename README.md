You can have as many translations as you want, but they must be preinstalled on the Bible Reader attached to the world or avatar. They are not streamed in or fetched from an online source when loading into the world. The reason for this is so that no user needs to enable `Allow Untrusted URLs`; translations will be included with the world/avatar when it loads. Translations are fairly large (for text files, around ~4MB), so having dozens and dozens of translations will add up the file size.
